# saturation_handling
Deblurring and Denoising images with outliers using the help of an optimum GAN module.

Main objectives:
1. Use the optimum GAN module for deblurring images.
2. Handle outliers (eg: saturation) while deblurring. 
3. Use traditional denoising networks for image denoising.
4. Combine all the three architectures to obtain the final working model.
